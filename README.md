# LSTM Time Series Forecasting

End-to-end multivariate time-series forecasting using LSTM, featuring sliding-window feature extraction, baseline benchmarking, and reproducible training and evaluation pipelines.

## Problem
Forecast future values of a multivariate time series using historical sliding windows, optimizing for prediction accuracy on unseen future data.

## Dataset
Jena Climate dataset (multivariate weather time series).

## Approach
- Time-based train/validation/test split
- Sliding-window feature extraction
- Naive baseline for comparison
- LSTM model for sequence learning

## Metrics
- MAE
- RMSE

## Project Structure
- `src/` – dataset, model, training, evaluation code
- `experiments/` – results and comparisons
- `diagrams/` – architecture diagrams

## How to Run
Instructions will be added as the project progresses.
